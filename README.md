Early and accurate diagnosis of multiple dental conditions remains a critical unmet need in clinical practice, where traditional visual and radiographic examinations are subjective and siloed by disease type. This study introduces MultiDentNet, a unified deep‐learning framework designed to automatically classify five common dental conditions caries, gingivitis, tooth discoloration, ulcers, and hypodontia from intraoral images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study to classify all five conditions simultaneously on this dataset; previous efforts have addressed at most one or two classes. To address the gap in multi‐condition diagnostic tools, we augment a DenseNet‐121 backbone with hierarchical self‐attention modules that capture both local lesion details and global context. Evaluated on a curated dataset of 6,791 training, 1,701 validation, and 947 test images, MultiDentNet achieves 99.37\% overall accuracy, 99.37\% precision, 99.37\% recall, F1-Score of 0.98, AUC of 1.00, and a log loss of 0.023.  The model maintains particularly strong performance on underrepresented classes, achieving an F1-score of 0.94 for Hypodontia. Interpretability analyses including t‐SNE feature clustering, one‐vs‐rest ROC and precision–recall curves, and confusion matrix visualizations demonstrate distinct class separation and minimal misclassification, highlighting both robustness and clinical relevance.
By integrating advanced attention mechanisms, class‐aware loss functions, and rigorous interpretability tools, this work delivers a novel, scalable, and clinically applicable AI solution for comprehensive dental diagnostics, setting the stage for real‐world decision support systems and future extensions to broader oral health conditions.
